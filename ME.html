              For our fifth consecutive year, Penn Robotics is continuing to
              assist our community through our Mission to Engineer program. This
              initiative aims to construct assistive technology (AT) for
              individuals who don’t have the resources to acquire it themselves.

          <p>
            Mission to Engineer was founded by ATMAkers and Penn Robotics in
            2017, all thanks to a family in need of assistive technology. The
            primary goal of ATMakes was to introduce those in need of Assistive
            Technology to local makers that would be willing to execute the
            project that needed to be done for the families in need. Prior to
            Mission to Engineer, Penn Robotics was one of the facilities that
            accepted the offer to help a family in need -the Hunt Family. Bill
            Binko, founder of ATMakers, first introduced Penn Robotics to the
            Hunt Family with very high expectations for the future. Upon their
            introduction, Team 135 was able to learn more about the diagnosis of
            Ella Hunt and the ways that they would be able to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ella was diagnosed with SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy)Type 1, a
            disease that prohibits her from developing muscle. Unfortunately,
            this diagnosis means that Ella is incapable of moving on her own,
            including the movement of her vocal cords. Although Ella is
            incapable of traditional speech, she is capable of communication
            with the use of an amplification device called the Eye Gaze. She
            struggles to express herself with her peers due to the challenges
            imposed by her condition. Team 135 states that, “We are trying to
            improve the quality of her life by developing technological
            solutions to everyday problems that people overlook, the ways of
            communication and entertainment. Not only are we trying to improve
            Ella’s life, but we are trying to further fellow students’
            understanding of engineering in the real world.” Shortly after Team
            135’s initial greet with Ella and her family, they began the project
            known as Engineering Ella. This project has been featured on
            multiple different websites, including Bill Binko’s ATMakers, and
            Adafruit and is still recognized as the project that started it all.
            Our objective is to share Ella’s story and to help provide other
            families with the support they deserve.

          <p>
            In early February of 2021, our team was introduced to a boy named
            Cooper New by Joe O’Reilly. Cooper has a rare genetic disorder and
            is faced with many obstacles when it comes to development and daily
            life. Our Mission to Engineer team, at the time, set out to design
            and build a sensory wall that he could use to help build auditory,
            sensory, and motor skills. We worked closely with the family to
            design the board with Cooper’s needs in mind, and we customized it
            to fit his personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sensory board we made is a 6 ft by 4 ft wooden board that has
            many different activities on it that he can engage with. The focal
            point is a soundboard that incorporates images with labels above
            them and 16 buttons that, when pressed, play a sound associated with
            the respective image/button pair. This portion of the board was
            critical as Cooper is enamored with sound and this feature draws his
            interest to the entire board. This sensory tool also encompasses
            three different instruments for auditory engagement, puzzle pieces
            with tactile objects for sensory engagement, and different types of
            door handles for motor skill improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the pandemic, Team 135 has worked through many roadblocks
            and setbacks as they presented themselves. We were welcomed into the
            family’s home on February 9, 2022, in order to install the sensory
            board into their basement. We were very thrilled to see the
            excitement come from Cooper’s face when we uncovered his new sensory
            wall. Cooper’s parents are now able to use this sensory wall for
            Cooper’s entertainment as well as development. They utilize
            different features to conduct therapy with Cooper. This is typically
            difficult as Cooper does not always want to engage with therapy.
            However, the sensory wall is full of sounds and other fun tools that
            enable Cooper to keep his attention and interest. Once Cooper has
            grown out of the sensory wall, the family will pass on the board to
            a local Autism center to continue helping individuals for years to
            come!

            Over the past couple of months, Penn Robotics has been working with
            Joe O’Reilly, Magic Wheelchair, Premier Arts, and various other Penn
            High School Classes to create a very special project for a very
            special boy, Zephan Cantu. Zephan has Cerebral Palsy and is bound to
            a wheelchair. His favorite superhero, as well as a nickname, is The
            Amazing Hulk, as a testament to all he has gone through due to his
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this project was a great interdisciplinary opportunity for
            Penn students to learn new skills and work with groups they wouldn’t
            otherwise work with, it is more than just an academic project. For
            five years, Penn Robotics has been working with children with
            disabilities, and we have encountered the same issue over and over
            again: the lack of inclusiveness for children with disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, much of the world is not designed with inclusiveness
            in mind. The lack of options for Halloween costumes for children in
            wheelchairs is what lead to the creation of the Magic Wheelchair
            organization in 2008. While progress has been made since then, there
            is still very much a demand for products that are made with the
            disabled community in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Penn Robotics is incredibly lucky to have the chance to work on this
            project and we have been fortunate to get media attention on both a
            local and national scale. With this exposure, we are hoping to send
            a message of inclusiveness. We don’t want this to be a one-time
            event, but rather, something that will spread throughout the nation
            to other schools and corporations who will hopefully realize the
            importance of embracing diversity and helping the communities that
            are so often overlooked.

            Last year, we were contacted by Mr. Addison, Isaiah’s gym teacher.
            Isaiah is a strong-willed fourth grader that is full of curiosity,
            creativity, and desire who also happens to be inflicted with
            Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC), a disease that affects the
            development of multiple joint contractures. While he and his family
            have been thriving on their own, we were contacted because Isaiah
            has been getting frustrated in the limited adaptations of the
            class’s “scooter game” he could do because of his condition. Soon
            after, we scheduled an initial meeting. This was a great chance for
            us to learn more about Isaiah and his needs and for them to learn
            more about us. From this meeting, we found out that Isaiah was
            having trouble with a simple daily task — putting on his socks. We
            have created a small sock aid for him and are working on the scooter
            adaptation.

            Ella has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA). This diagnosis
            prohibits her from moving on her own and speaking because of the
            underdevelopment of body muscle. Team 135’s goal was (and is) to
            improve the quality of her life by developing technological
            solutions to her everyday problems, such as communication and
            entertainment. One of the various projects we did for Ella was
            reprogramming her powered wheelchair, with this, Ella had the
            autonomy to move her own wheelchair, something most people with SMA
            are not able to do. We also worked on a variety of other projects
            for Ella, such as a food tube overflow sensor, an arm stabilizer,
            and adapting tools.

            Braylen has Joubert Syndrome, which is a disease leading to the
            underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis and a malformed brain
            stem. This led Braylen to have issues with low muscle tone, leading
            to balance and coordination issues and speech impediments. To allow
            Braylen to communicate with his peers, he has a communication tablet
            called the Accent 800. However, this tablet is 2.4 pounds and far
            too heavy for him to carry throughout his day. This reduced the
            effectiveness of the device considering he couldn’t take it to
            recess, a vital time for him to communicate with his friends. To
            solve this problem, Penn Robotics created a mobile table that he
            could take anywhere, allowing him to communicate with his peers all
            throughout the day.

            Our first assistive technology creation was a prosthetic arm
            designed to help Grace, a young girl born without half of her right
            arm, gain more mobility and independence. Everywhere Grace went, she
            would struggle to interact with her peers due to this physical
            disability. This was our first ever assistive technology project and
            it opened our eyes to a much bigger world around us. We 3D printed a
            prosthetic arm for her and used a muscle sensor, Arduino, and servos
            to allow her to interact with objects with her new hand.

            On January 26, 2022, Penn Robotics Team 135 students traveled down
            to Orlando, Florida in order to share information about our Mission
            to Engineer Program and showcase the projects that our ME team has
            completed. We had a great opportunity to showcase the sensory board
            we created for Cooper, a boy in our community who is faced with many
            obstacles when it comes to his learning development. The main goal
            of our presentation was to reconnect with AT professionals, such as
            Bill Binko (founder of ATMakers) and to learn more about the AT
            community. Throughout the conference and the Maker Day we interacted
            with lots of Assistive Technology professionals, Occupational
            Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists (PT), educators, and more. It
            was such an incredible opportunity for our ME team to make these
            connections and see the professional side of the AT industry. This
            event allowed our Mission to Engineer program to learn more about
            Assistive Technology and what path the program could take in the
            future.

            Due to Covid-19 the ATIA conference could not be held in Orlando,

            Our team of two seniors and two juniors, presented about our past
            projects and the overall message of our Mission to Engineer (ME)
            program. Our student presenters were also given the opportunity to
            attend virtual sessions presented by Assistive Technology
            professionals, Occupational Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists
            (PT), educators, and more. Although virtual, this event allowed our

            Occupational Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists (PT), educators,
            and people with a wide range of disabilities. Being one of the two
            FRC teams presenting, Team 135 was honored with a 90-minute
            presentation slot to present ME. With an involved audience, we were
            able to tell our assistive technology story starting from Hand of
            Grace, going all the way to the current day with Innovations for
            Isaiah. We were also able to promote our ever-growing network of FRC
            teams able to help us with our cause. On the final day of the
            conference, our partner ATMakers (founded by Bill Binko), invited us
            back to the Exhibit Hall with a booth at their Maker Day 2.0. This
            is a widely loved part of ATIA where attendees get to learn more
            about what goes into making simple assistive technology. We talked
            with many people about ME while showing our outreach bot, Kiwi.

            After months of planning, FRC Team 135’s Mission to Engineer team
            hopped on a plane to sunny Orlando, Florida to present at the
            Assistive Technology Industry Association (ATIA) conference. The
            ATIA conference is a gathering of Assistive Technology vendors,
            Occupational Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists (PT), educators,
            and people with a wide range of disabilities.

            The largest attraction at this conference was the Exhibit Hall where
            hundreds of companies (including Google, Microsoft, and AbleNet)
            promoted their assistive technology devices and software to other
            vendors and medical professionals. Browsing around the Exhibit Hall,
            we were able to learn a lot about the current products on the market
            in the assistive technology community and how they can be
            implemented into people’s daily lives.
          </p>

            The heart and soul of ATIA, however, is the abundance of
            presentations that are held throughout the week. Being one of the
            two FRC teams presenting, Team 135 was honored with a 90 minute
            presentation slot at this highly esteemed conference. With an
            involved audience, we were able to tell our assistive technology
            story starting from Hand of Grace (2015), going all the way to
            current day with Innovations for Isaiah (2019). We were also able to
            promote our ever growing network of FIRST Robotics Competition teams
            able to help us with our cause.

            On the final day of the conference, our partner ATMakers (founded by
            Bill Binko), invited us back to the Exhibit Hall with a booth at
            their Maker Day 2.0. This is a widely loved part of ATIA where
            attendees get to learn more about what goes into making many of the
            simple devices assistive technology uses. Makers Making Change held
            the “learn to solder” booth, while others held booths about
            instamorph and 3D printing. Team 135’s Mission to Engineer team held
            a presentation booth with a demo of our outreach robot named “Kiwi.”
            We talked to a lot of incredibly supportive attendees, and we’re
            excited to return to ATIA in 2020.

            Penn Robotics Team 135 was invited to attend ATIA 2018 in order to
            present our project Mission to Engineer at a speaker session,
            alongside ATMakers founder Bill Binko and president of Inclusive
            Technology Solutions, LLC Mike Marotta, and during the MakerDay.
            Italia Fields, David Li, Olivia Adam, and Jim Langfeldt arrived in
            Orlando on January 31th and immediately hit the exhibit hall where
            we were able to meet some of the most prestigious AT providers and
            witness soon-to-be-released technology. The next day, Fields’
            presentation focused on cost-effective AT solutions through local
            makers such as Penn Robotics. “It was an amazing opportunity to
            present alongside Bill Binko and Mike Marotta,” Italia said, “Both
            of them are huge figures in the AT Maker community. They taught me
            the importance of an AT program like the one we created, Mission to
            Engineer.” On Saturday, the team set up a presentation booth,
            brought an outreach robot, and delivered Mission to Engineer
            in-depth at the MakerDay. Our project garnered the attention of many
            of the attendees, some noting that this year’s conference was one of
            the most energetic and memorable conferences they have seen. “In the
            21 years of Penn Robotics, this conference was the most impactful
            community outreach event we’ve ever been apart of,” said Jim
            Langfeldt, Robotics Coach. Overall, thousands of individuals were
            directly impacted by our attendance at ATIA.

          For the 2020 holiday season, Penn Robotics hosted a robotics fair for
          families to enjoy! Our goal was to take our annual Adapt-A-Thon event
          and make it friendly and exciting, alongside offering kids an
          experience they would not get at a normal fair. So this year, Penn
          decided to transform their Adapt-A-Thon event into a drive-thru fair,
          with activities for everyone to participate in!

          Every year, during the holidays, many children with disabilities
          aren’t able to purchase switch adapted toys due to the astronomical
          prices of toys and switches from vendors. We created this event so
          children aren’t hindered from having their dream toys and experience
          the joy of the holiday season.

        </div>
        <div class="section">
          Families came to the fair throughout the day and enjoyed a variety of
          events; from tic-tac-toe, to experiencing robotics, to picking out a
          toy to take home. As kids came to the fair, they were able to pick out
          a toy, talk to the team, and experience robotics and how it can help
          improve and develop our community. The remaining toys from the
          Adapt-A-Thon will be donated to local organizations that work with
          kids with disabilities.

            The goal of our Mission to Engineer program has always been to make
            connections between people in need of Assistive Technology and
            people that can help. We want to make that goal a reality by using
            responses we get from the Google Form below to connect people in
            need of AT to robotics teams and others that can help.
