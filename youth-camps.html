            Penn Robotics Mentors went to all 11 PHM elementary schools to
            mentor the Short Circuits program. Over the course of a month, we
            met 4 times to teach them how to use block codes to make a Sphero
            Bolt complete different complex exercises. This culminated into a
            final celebration in our robotics lab where they showcased their
            programs to their parents and teachers, as well as members of our
            education foundation, school board members, and our district’s
            superintendent. Following this program, many more of our district’s
            teachers and parents are now interested in continuing to support
            robotics in our schools.

            Not only do we provide students with a unique one-on-one, hands-on
            learning experience, but we make sure your kids have fun in the
            process! Coopertition (cooperation and competition) is a large part
            of robotics at the high school level, and we make sure we bring that
            same experience to your kids when they enroll in any of our Penn
            Robotics Youth Camps.

            We offer eight separate camps for students ages 1st through 8th
            grade. Skill levels differ from camp to camp, but there if your
            student is interested in STEM and robotics we most certainly have a
            camp for them!

          Our school’s Junior STEM camps teach K-5 grade students important
          real-world concepts such as critical-thinking, problem-solving, and
          teamwork while building robots and having fun!

          <p>
            In the camps, students work in teams to design, build and code a
            robot to complete various challenges. Each day, students are given a
            robot challenge such as lifting an object and placing in a specific
            location, completing an obstacle course, climbing an incline with
            weights, and more. Students learn about engineering principles such
            as torque, tension, and mechanics that would help with the
            challenge.

          <p id="right">
            After the challenge is given, students are given isometric graph
            paper and asked to sketch their designs. Each team discusses the
            best design for the robot, then the students begin to build using
            the VEX IQ Kits. VEX IQ Kits include a platform made out of a
            material similar to Legos, so students of all ages can easily build
            a robot and make adjustments as needed. <br /><br />To program the
            robot, students use a platform similar to Scratch called RobotC
            Graphical. In the platform, students learn how to program a robot
            using a robot controller and a pre-coded program. Finally, each team
            works together to complete the challenge before they move to the
            next rotation.

          To keep students engaged in STEM throughout the year, we offer two-day

              computer model to life using our 3D printers and/or CNC laser
              cuter. Students are able to gain hands-on knowledge and experience

              skills to develop solutions to the challenge at hand when

              drive through an obstacle course. Students will gain valuable
              knowledge in building and programming a custom robot to compete on
              a challenge course. This workshop will greatly help students
              hoping to take engineering courses at Penn, as VEX is commonly
              used in these classes.
