                To continue the tradition Penn Robotics hosted our annual summer
                camps in 2023, hosting students grades K-8th from throughout the
                school district. In our Manufacturing camp students were able to
                learn hands-on operation of machines such as mills, the CNC, and
                the laser cutter, using these in the production of a customized
                totem to take home at the end of the week. Mentors of Creativity
                challenged campers to learn key STEM concepts by competing to
                build the most stable satellites, tallest moon bases, and
                fastest rovers, ending the camp by designing their own rockets
                and launching them sky-high. Additionally, they learned
                about electricity by creating airplane toys with working motors,
                inspiring them to continue programming and being involved with
                STEM. The second week featured our Build-a-Bot camps; these
                emulate the FIRST robotics competition in guiding kids through
                the creation, programming, and driving of either a Vex IQ or EDR
                robot in order to complete game challenges developed by the Penn
                Robotics teams. For this year’s IQ camp the challenge was called
                Lunar Launch, which included rockets robots had to fuel and
                dangerous asteroids to clear. The game for EDR was Moon Mayhem,
                featuring a spinning moon and satellite arrays that teams had to
                traverse to deliver moon rocks and gems back to their factories.

                activities. The 77 kids that participated (Grades 1-7) in this
                event were introduced to the topics of gravity, circuitry,
                buoyancy, and pneumatics. Our mentors made sure every camper was
                able to take away valuable STEM skills that they are able to
                apply to real work concepts in their futures.

                teaching STEM skills through a variety of different ways.These
                kids were able construct their own laser cut trains, which they
                then put through a series of challenges and activities. This
                camp has grown to over 6 times the size of our previous Fall
                Workshop, with 88 students attending this year! We also provided
                several scholarships to our camp to make this camp as accessible
                as possible. We hope to continue inspiring STEM education for
                these students in our community.

                learn hands-on operation of machines such as mills, the CNC, and
                the laser cutter, using these in the production of a customized
                totem to take home at the end of the week. Mentors of Creativity
                challenged campers to learn key STEM concepts by competing to
                build the most stable satellites, tallest moon bases, and
                fastest rovers, ending the camp by designing their own rockets
                and launching them sky-high. Design students worked with CAD
                using Fusion, and built their own race cars to send flying down
                the air-pressure track in exciting high-speed races against
                their peers. In Software, we taught fundamental concepts of
                programming through the use of the BBC Micro Bit, exciting the
                campers by letting them watch their code come to life, including
                music and games they could play; additionally, they learned
                about electricity by creating airplane toys with working motors,
                inspiring them to continue programming and being involved with
                STEM. The second week featured our Build-a-Bot camps; these
                emulate the FIRST robotics competition in guiding kids through
                the creation, programming, and driving of either a Vex IQ or EDR

                Robotics teams. For this year’s IQ camp the challenge was called
                Lunar Launch, which included rockets robots had to fuel and

                the projects that our ME team has completed. We had a great
                opportunity to showcase the sensory board we created for Cooper,
                a boy in our community who is faced with many obstacles when it
                comes to his learning development. The main goal of our
                presentation was to reconnect with AT professionals, such as
                Bill Binko (founder of ATMakers) and to learn more about the AT
                community. Throughout the conference and the Maker Day we
                interacted with lots of Assistive Technology professionals,
                Occupational Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists (PT),
                educators, and more. It was such an incredible opportunity for
                our ME team to make these connections and see the professional
                side of the AT industry. This event allowed our Mission to
                Engineer program to learn more about Assistive Technology and
                what path the program could take in the future.

                We held a Nelson’s chicken sale at River Valley Church. To
                ensure this event’s success, we used a pre-sale system of
                redeemable tickets which we sold in the weeks leading up to the
                event. Due to our efforts in coordination and documentation, the
                pre-sale process was extraordinarily successful. Our Team sold
                753 chicken and 506 potato tickets a week before the event even
                took place. From there, we notified Nelson’s of our order and
                prepared further for our actual “day of” sale. Ordering 1000
                chickens and 700 potatoes, this was one of the largest Nelson’s
                chicken sales in Penn Robotics history. The day of the event,
                many members of FTC, FRC, and other volunteers spent six hours
                distributing all of our food to those who ordered. The sale was
                extremely successful, raising more money at one location than
                the previous year’s did with two sales. Penn Robotics netted
                over $5,000 through this sale, and we are excited to spend it as
                we tackle our upcoming 2022 season!

                Penn Robotics hosted the annual FTC Kickoff on September 18,
                2021, where we revealed this season’s challenge and gave several
                presentations to provide teams with a stepping stone for the
                coming year. This event attracts teams from around the area to
                come watch as the FTC game for this season is revealed, and this
                year we reached 10 FTC teams and around 90 people. Members from
                three veteran FTC teams and our own FRC team gave presentations,
                which helped the new FTC teams understand and familiarize
                themselves with key aspects of high achieving teams. In addition
                to our presentations, we provided a reveal of the playing field,
                allowing teams to get close to and physically interact with the
                field and game elements. With what we did at the Kickoff, we
                hope to improve these FTC teams’ chances of success in the

                Penn Robotics persevered through the pandemic to continue its
                tradition of hosting STEM summer camps. During our first week of
                summer camps, we held multiple interactive programs where kids
                get to learn more in-depth about aspects of engineering! These
                programs had kids participate in a variety of challenges that
                they overcame using their knowledge of engineering principals.
                Week 2, which is our Penn Build-a-Bot VEX IQ & EDR camps,
                challenged students to design, build, and program their own
                unique robots to compete in a FIRST style game. Using
                Computer-Aided Design, laser cutters, and code they wrote, they
                competed against each other. They spent their time in the camp
                learning 3D design, coding, assembly, and most importantly,
                teamwork! In total, we reached almost 200 families and over 300
                students, including about 20 students from outside of our
                district. We’re incredibly happy to be able to teach so many the
                ins and outs of engineering, and hope to do so next year as
                well.

                For the 2020 holiday season, Penn Robotics hosted an event for
                families to enjoy: A Robotics Fair! Our goal was to take our
                Adapt-A-Thon event and make it friendly and exciting, alongside
                offering kids an experience they would not get at a normal fair.
                So this year, Penn decided to transform our Adapt-A-Thon event
                into a drive-thru fair, with activities for everyone to
                participate in! Every year, during the holidays, many children
                with disabilities aren’t able to purchase switch adapted toys
                due to the astronomical prices of toys and switches from
                vendors. We created this event so children aren’t hindered from
                having their dream toys and experience the joy of the holiday
                season. Families came to the fair throughout the day and enjoyed
                a variety of events; from tic-tac-toe, to experiencing robotics,
                to picking out a toy to take home. As kids came to the fair,
                they were able to pick out a toy, talk to the team, and
                experience robotics and how it can help improve and develop our
                community. The remaining toys from the Adapt-A-Thon will be
                donated to local organizations that work with kids with
                disabilities.

                competing in one of the most competitive FRC Districts in

                was a success; We gained insight to improve our shooting system
                for power cells, as well as discover flaws that can be fixed for
                future events. Furthermore, our Chairman’s sub-team was able to
                have some valuable dialogue with Team 2834 The Bionic
                Blackhawks, who is an FRC Hall of Fame team. During alliance

                772 (Sabre Bytes) and Team 2834 (Bionic Blackhawks). Although we

                ATIA (Assistive Technology Industry Association) hosts a
                conference that Team 135 participates in almost every year. The
                organization helps spread technology and awareness with the goal
                of improving the lives of those with disabilities, which is the
                perfect place for Penn Robotics! At ATIA 2020, Penn showcased
                and presented their ME (Mission to Engineer) project at the
                event, and the feedback was very positive! Many people were not
                only impressed by what team 135 was doing, but they were
                inspired to help others in need. As Penn learned from others who
                presented, other people learned about our mission with FIRST to
                change the world!

                Penn Robotics helped with running the annual FLL competition
                along with Mishawaka robotics. With both the FRC and FTC
                students helping out, this event was a huge success! There were
                about 450 people that attended the event, including over 20
                teams, coaches, mentors, volunteers, and community members. Like
                always, FLL teams presented the non-game aspects of their team
                in three judging categories: “Project”, “Core Values”, and
                “Technical”. In these areas, teams were judged based on the hard
                work and dedication showcased towards effectively executing the
                requirements/tasks of each judging category whilst integrating
                the values of FIRST and STEM. We also had a few FRC members
                present to students and parents during the event regarding the
                robotics programs, summer camps, and STEM opportunities offered
                at Penn as well as their benefits to further assisting in the
                development of innovative and collaborative thinking today’s
                youth. Teams then went on to compete in the main event, the
                robot competition! During the robot matches, teams competed in
                that year’s FLL challenge: City Shaper! In the end, all teams
                performed wonderfully! Regarding volunteers during the event,
                Penn students helped with running “official positions”,
                consisting of judging room timers, door keepers, judge’s
                assistants, robot-run helpers, and various other positions. We
                also had both the FRC and FTC booths set up at the event,
                including the FTC field, competition robots, and various other
                outreach props. Volunteers interacted with various community
                members, teams, alumni, and school leaders and showcased the
                values of Penn Robotics, FIRST, and STEM. Various community
                members expressed positive regard to their experience and time
                at the event, including school leaders such as Mr. Galiher
                (Principal of Penn High School)! Overall, this event ran
                smoothly and was a tremendous success. We look forward to
                helping out with running the FLL tournament again next year!

                Penn Robotics went to the annual PHMEF Superintendents Luncheon.
                We set up in front of the main entrance door and displayed our
                ME (Mission to Engineer) and robotics information. Approximately
                300 people showed up at this event and all of them got to see
                our table set up before they entered the conference hall. It was
                really exciting to talk about STEM and FIRST programs and tell
                people how these programs can impact our community. We had some
                technical issues but we managed to fix them in a pretty short
                time span. We got to listen to a few speakers during the
                luncheon. Most notably, the guest speaker Sarah Hildebrant. A
                few people compliment complimented our team for our robotics
                program as they were passing by; overall, it was a success! Next
                time we should only bring one robot and give some notes to Dr.
                Thacker so he could talk about our program during his speech and
                also improve the packing list so the process of getting
                everything prepped for an event becomes more fluid.

                For the 2019 holiday season, Penn Robotics Team 135 partnered up
                with Beacon health Foundation to run an Adapt-A-Thon. Our goal
                was to give away free adapted toys to children in need and help
                them experience the magic of the holidays. The toys consist of
                stuffed animals that make lights, sounds, or movements when a
                button is pressed. The premise of the event was adapting
                electronic toys to become compatible with switches (a sensitive
                button that people with disabilities can activate), so children
                with disabilities can play with them. We also gave away our
                custom made switches, which can be fairly expensive to buy
                normally, for free. As we are approaching the holidays, many
                children with disabilities will not be able to purchase switch
                adapted toys that they can interact with due to the astronomical
                prices of toys and switches from vendors. We hope these toys
                will allow the children a form of autonomy in their lives and
                give inclusivity by allowing them a similar experience and joy
                like their peers. At the event, we had a table of toys for
                children to pick from, and we were able to adapt the toys as
                people came in with them. There were stations set up for games
                and prizes in addition to an adapting station, where people can
                see the wiring close up if they would like to. We were able to
                do a couple of extra-special adaptations, including adapting a
                toy car so that a child with disabilities could drive it. The
                remaining toys from the Adapt-A-Thon will be donated to local
                organizations that work with kids with disabilities.

                Technovation is a yearly teacher conference at Penn High School.
                The goal of the conference is to encourage teachers to explore
                teaching using technology and learn about how they can better do
                this. This year, Penn Robotics did three presentations at the
                conference and held a booth in the library with information
                about our program and demonstration robots for attendees to
                drive. One of our presentations was centered around Mission to
                Engineer and the importance of the program as well as how the
                teachers can utilize it as a learning opportunity. Our other
                presentation was an escape room. The escape room was especially
                popular and taught teachers team building skills. Our other team
                presented how the FIRST program introduces project-based
                learning to students and how to produce a similar model for
                conventional classroom use. The team engaged each teacher who
                attended by discussing the different benefits of project-based
                learning, better retention of lessons, and the introduction of
                important attributes such as critical thinking, teamwork, and
                problem-solving. Through the presentation, we were able to
                establish contact with a teacher interested in starting an FLL
                team. In all the presentations, we had an opportunity to show
                teachers all across Indiana what Team 135 and the FIRST program
                entails as well as how it benefits students.

                Penn Robotics hosted our second annual FTC kickoff.
                Approximately 150 people showed up to represent almost 30 FTC
                teams. Before the event, we held a food social where people
                could come and get to know each other. Afterward, we held seven
                different tech sessions, four of which were presented by 135
                members. The game was released and we let the teams get on the
                field and begin brainstorming. The FTC Kickoff is a very
                important event because FTC offers a direct line to FRC, which
                makes supporting FTC a major aspect of Penn Robotics’
                sustainability. FTC Kickoff also helps us break the barrier
                between FTC and FRC. The event was very successful and we got a
                lot of compliments from parents and coaches. Any outreach event
                we take part in helps spread the message about what we do here
                at Penn Robotics.

                The back to school night was a great success for Penn Robotics.
                We disseminated to the various elementary schools in PHM in
                order to spread the message of the FLL teams we were going to
                start. We managed to get to a decent amount of elementary
                schools, and because we started our first FLL team at Penn,
                Students would describe the event as a great success. One of the
                best moments of the event was when kids would literally drag
                their parents over when they saw our booth. There are a lot of
                things to improve on, however. We started to plan the event way
                too late and not a lot of people showed up. Additionally we did
                not follow through on asking for people to volunteer. Our stuff
                was not fully packed up for the first couple of events and
                because of the short time deadline, it was a bit of a mess. In
                order to fix this situation, we need to get a master packing
                list way ahead of time and start planning the event at least two
                weeks in advance to stop this from happening again, as well as
                ask for volunteers in advance.
